(*  1
  Define a function named mymap1 with the same type and behavior as built-in map
  function without actually using map . This should be one line of code and
  should use foldr or foldl. (Refer to problem Exercise 24 on page 147.) *)
fun mymap1 _ = "1 NOT FINISHED";


(*  2
  Define a function named mymap2 with the same type and behavior as map , but unlike
  before you may not use foldr nor foldl. You still cannot use map itself either.
  (Refer to problem Exercise 26 on page 147.) *)
fun mymap2 _ = "2 NOT FINISHED";

(*  3
  Write a function named ordlist of type char list -> int list that take a list
  of characters and returns the list of integer codes of those characters.
  For example, if you evaluate ordlist [#”A”,#”b”,#”C”] you should get [65, 98, 67].
  (Refer to Exercise 2 on page 144.) *)
fun ordlist _ = "3 NOT FINISHED";

(*  4
  Write a function named mylength of type ‘a list -> int that returns the length
  of a list. You cannot use the built-in length function.
  (Refer to Exercise 11 on page 145.) *)
fun mylength _ = "4 NOT FINISHED";

(*  5
  Write a function named max of type int list -> int that returns the largest
  element of a list of integers. Your function must use either foldr or foldl
  and need not behave well if the list is empty. (Yes, this is the same function
  from Project 1. Here you must use a fold variant rather than recursion.) *)
fun max _ = "5 NOT FINISHED";
